		<p><strong><em>BT-7274 is  Vanguard-class Titan</em></strong>, the first to be designed by the Militia.
		With Vanguards, The Militia no longer needed to steal IMC Titans off the production li
		nes to supply their Pilots. A Vanguard-class Titan must obey three protocols:</p>

		<p>Protocol 1: Link to Pilot</p>

		<p>Protocol 2: Uphold the Mission</p>

		<p>Protocol 3: Protect the Pilot</p>

		<p>While the 
		IMC considers its Titans and Pilots to be interchangeable and disposable, the Militia views each of its new Vanguard Pilot-Titan units as a long-term 
		investment. As a result, an experienced Vanguard Titan-Pilot team is far more flexible and deadlier than any single IMC Titan and Pilot on the Frontier
		.To BT-7274, his Pilot isn't just a teammate, but also a friend. </p>
